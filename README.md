# EDA Web App using NextJS

## üìä Project Overview

This project provides an interactive and user-friendly web interface for performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on CSV files.

- The **frontend** is developed using **Next.js**, which provides a responsive and modern UI.
- The **backend** is built using **FastAPI** in Python and handles all the EDA logic (data cleaning, summarization, visualization).
- The **Next.js frontend communicates with the FastAPI backend via HTTP API calls** to process and analyze the data.

### üîß What It Does

- Lets users upload a CSV file through the web interface
- Sends the file to the FastAPI backend using an API call
- Returns processed data summaries and visualizations to be displayed in the frontend
- Also includes a sample dataset for instant demonstration
